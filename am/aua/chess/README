Chess Game (Java GUI & Console)

This is a Java-based chess game featuring both a graphical user interface (GUI) built with
Swing and a console-based interface for terminal interaction. The project models all chess
pieces, rules of movement, and basic game flow (excluding advanced rules like castling,
en passant, or checkmate detection).

Features
- Full 8×8 chessboard with classic starting arrangement
- Piece movement and capture logic for all standard pieces
- Graphical interface with click-based move selection
- Console interface with text-based commands
- Puzzle system with difficulty sorting and file-based storage
- Object-oriented design using Java best practices

Technologies Used
- Java (Core + Swing)
- Object-Oriented Programming principles
- Custom exceptions, interfaces, and UI rendering

How to Run

Run GUI (default):
    java -cp . am.aua.chess.Main

Run Console Version:
    java -cp . am.aua.chess.Main -console

Project Structure
- am.aua.chess.core: Core logic (board, pieces, positions, moves)
- am.aua.chess.puzzles: Puzzle handling (load, save, sort)
- am.aua.chess.ui: GUI implementation using Swing
- am.aua.chess.cli: Console version for text-based interaction

Background
This project was written during my freshman year of university as a series of homeworks
for my Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class. It represents one of my earliest complete
software projects and was an excellent introduction to designing real-world systems using
Java and OOP concepts.

Limitations
- No check, checkmate, or stalemate detection
- No castling, promotion, or en passant
- Multiplayer not implemented — intended for learning and testing
